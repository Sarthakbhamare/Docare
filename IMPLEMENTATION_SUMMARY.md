## Maintenance Notes

### Adding New Pages
Follow this pattern for consistency:
1. Create `assets/js/pages/your-page.js` with module exports
2. Create `assets/css/pages/your-page.css` using design tokens
3. Add route to `app.js` routes object
4. Add navigation item to `privateNavItems` array
5. Add i18n strings to `i18n.js`
6. Import CSS in `index.html`
7. Add quick action link to dashboard if needed

### Updating Mock Data
- Mock data is at the top of each page module
- Keep data structures consistent with real API responses
- Include realistic dates, amounts, and status variations
- Test edge cases (empty states, long strings, etc.)

### Styling Guidelines
- Always use CSS custom properties (design tokens)
- Follow mobile-first responsive approach
- Keep specificity low (avoid deep nesting)
- Use BEM naming convention for clarity
- Test across breakpoints before committing

- ✓ Full functionality and event handling
