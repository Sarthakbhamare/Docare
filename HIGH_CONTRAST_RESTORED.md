### Original High Contrast Mode Features:

âœ… **Pure white text** (`#FFFFFF`) on dark backgrounds  
âœ… **WCAG AAA compliance** - 7:1 contrast ratio  

### How to Test:

1. Open http://localhost:8000

3. See the original high contrast theme with:
   - Bright cyan borders (3-4px)
   - Neon green accents
   - Glowing hover effects

### What's Back:

## Summary

All changes have been reverted. Your high contrast mode is now back to its original implementation with bright cyan, neon green, thick borders, and glowing effects. The "dark mode" experiment has been completely removed, and everything is exactly as it was with the original high contrast design.
