# 🔧 GitHub Pages 404 Error - Troubleshooting & Fix

## 🚨 Issue
Site shows "Page not found" at: https://sarthakbhamare.github.io/Docare/

## ✅ What We Fixed

### 1. Added `.nojekyll` File
**Problem**: GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default, which can interfere with:
- ES6 module imports
- Folders starting with underscores
- Static file serving

**Solution**: Created `.nojekyll` file in root to disable Jekyll processing.

### 2. Repository Structure Verified
```
E:\DoCare\
├── .nojekyll          ✅ NEW - Disables Jekyll
├── index.html         ✅ In root (required!)
├── assets/
│   ├── css/          ✅ All stylesheets
│   ├── js/           ✅ All JavaScript modules
│   └── img/          ✅ Assets images (just added)
├── img/              ✅ Logo and main images
└── README.md
```

### 3. Files Committed
- ✅ `.nojekyll` - Disable Jekyll processing
- ✅ `assets/img/` - 6 additional image files
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md` - Documentation

## 🔍 Why Was It Showing 404?

### Possible Causes:
1. **Jekyll Processing**: Jekyll was possibly ignoring certain files/folders
2. **Build Delay**: GitHub Pages takes 2-5 minutes to rebuild
3. **Cache Issue**: Browser or CDN cache showing old version
4. **Path Issues**: SPA routing conflicts with static hosting

---

## ⏰ Next Steps - WAIT & TEST

### Step 1: Wait for GitHub Pages Rebuild (2-5 minutes)
The site needs time to rebuild after pushing the `.nojekyll` file.

**Check deployment status**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/Sarthakbhamare/Docare/actions
2. Look for "pages build and deployment" workflow
3. Wait for green checkmark ✅

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
After deployment completes:
- **Windows**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
- Or use Incognito/Private mode

### Step 3: Test These URLs

**Main site**: https://sarthakbhamare.github.io/Docare/
- Should show: Homepage with navigation

**Direct file**: https://sarthakbhamare.github.io/Docare/index.html
- Should show: Same homepage

**Assets**: https://sarthakbhamare.github.io/Docare/assets/js/app.js
- Should show: JavaScript code (or download prompt)

## 🆘 If Still 404 After 5 Minutes

### Check GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to: https://github.com/Sarthakbhamare/Docare/settings/pages
2. Verify:
   - ✅ Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - ✅ Branch: `main`
   - ✅ Folder: `/ (root)`
3. If settings look wrong, re-save them

### Check Repository Visibility
1. Go to: https://github.com/Sarthakbhamare/Docare/settings
2. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
3. Verify: Repository is **PUBLIC** (required for free GitHub Pages)

### Manual Trigger Deployment
1. Go to: https://github.com/Sarthakbhamare/Docare/actions
2. Click "pages build and deployment" workflow
3. Click "Re-run all jobs" if available

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

### When Site Loads:
1. **Homepage renders** with DoCare branding
2. **Logo visible** in header
3. **Navigation menu** functional
4. **Hash routing works**: URLs like `/#/symptom-checker`
5. **ES6 modules load** without CORS errors

### Test Symptom Checker:
1. Navigate to Symptom Checker
2. Type: "fever and cough"
3. Should show: Multiple conditions with percentages
4. Videos should be clickable

---

## 🔧 Alternative: Test Locally First

While waiting for GitHub Pages:

```bash
cd E:\DoCare
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8000

This should work perfectly and match what GitHub Pages will show.
