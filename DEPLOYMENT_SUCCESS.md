# 🎉 GitHub Pages Deployment - FIXED!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem
Your site at `https://sarthakbhamare.github.io/Docare/` was showing a blank page because:
- All application files were in a `DoCare` subdirectory
- GitHub Pages was looking for `index.html` in the root directory
- The `img/` folder was being ignored by `.gitignore`

### Solution Applied
1. ✅ **Moved all files to root**: Relocated everything from `E:\DoCare\DoCare\` to `E:\DoCare\`
2. ✅ **Fixed .gitignore**: Removed the `img/` exclusion so logo and images are now tracked
3. ✅ **Committed and pushed**: All 52 files + 6 image files are now in the correct location
